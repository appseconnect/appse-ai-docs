Sage X3 is a comprehensive enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution designed for mid-market businesses. With appse ai, you can seamlessly connect to your Sage X3 instance, automate item, inventory, and price list synchronization, and create customers and sales orders — all without writing SOAP or XML, enhancing efficiency across your supply chain and customer management workflows.

---

## Setup Credential

Follow the steps below to quickly set up your credential.

### Required Fields

You'll need to provide:

| Field                    | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Connection Name          | A name to identify the connection                                          |
| SOAP Endpoint URL        | The Syracuse SOAP web services endpoint for your Sage X3 instance         |
| Username                 | Your Sage X3 login username                                                |
| Password                 | Your Sage X3 login password                                                |
| Web Service Pool Alias   | The pool alias configured in your X3 instance                             |
| Language Code            | The language code used for returned messages from X3                       |

---

### Step-by-Step Guide

##### 1. Add Connection Name

- Enter a user-friendly name to identify this connection (e.g., `Sage X3 Production`, `X3 Finance`).
- This is only for reference within the appse ai platform.

---

##### 2. Locate Your SOAP Endpoint URL

- Log in to your **Sage X3** instance.
- Navigate to the **Administration** section.
- The SOAP endpoint URL follows this pattern:
  
  ```
  https://your-x3-host/soap-generic/syracuse/collaboration/syracuse/CAdxWebServiceXmlCC
  ```

- Replace `your-x3-host` with your actual Sage X3 host address.

> **Example**: `https://x3-prod.company.com/soap-generic/syracuse/collaboration/syracuse/CAdxWebServiceXmlCC`

---

##### 3. Enter Your Sage X3 Credentials

- Provide your **Username** and **Password** for your Sage X3 login.
- These credentials must have appropriate permissions to access the web services.

---

##### 4. Identify Your Web Service Pool Alias

- In your **Sage X3** instance, navigate to **Administration** → **Administration** → **Web services** → **Classic SOAP pools configuration**.

  <!-- <img src="/img/credentials/sage-x3/sage-x3-pool-alias-navigation.jpg" alt="appse ai Sage X3 - Classic SOAP Pools Configuration" width="700" /> -->

- Locate the **Pool Alias** you want to use for this integration (e.g., `APPSE`).
- Copy and enter this value in the credential form.

> **Example**: `APPSE`

> **Note**: The pool alias remains the same for all actions and triggers. A pool serves any published web service on its endpoint, so it represents connection state rather than per-operation configuration. Use a separate credential for a different X3 folder or pool.

---

##### 5. Specify the Language Code

- Enter the **Language Code** used by your Sage X3 instance for returned messages (e.g., `ENG` for English, `FRA` for French).
- This ensures error and confirmation messages are returned in your preferred language.

> **Example**: `ENG`

---

##### 6. Save and Authorize

- Once you've filled in all the required fields, click **"Save"** to verify your setup.

  <img src="/img/credentials/sage-x3/sage-x3-cred-save-authorize.jpg" alt="appse ai Sage X3 Credential - Save and Authorize" width="700" />

- If successful, your credential will show a "✓" icon. Now you can use this application for your integrations.
- If it fails, you will be displayed a "!" icon with an error message. Common issues include:
  - **"rejected the credentials (HTTP 401)"** — Wrong username/password or insufficient permissions for the pool
  - **"Record does not exist"** or other X3 text — Wrong pool alias
  - **"not a valid URL"** — Endpoint URL is malformed or missing the `CAdxWebServiceXmlCC` path
  - **Connection error** — Host is unreachable from appse ai

---

## Triggers and Actions

Every application has a pre-defined set of triggers and actions that allow users to perform application-specific activities within the platform. Here is a list of all triggers and actions available.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="triggers" label="Triggers">

### Triggers

#### Items Created or Updated

The **Items Created or Updated** trigger polls for item master records created or changed since a specified watermark in your Sage X3 instance, using the `YGETITM` web service.

##### Select Credentials and Action Events

<img src="/img/credentials/sage-x3/sage-x3-trigger-items-select-credential.jpg" alt="appse ai Sage X3 Items Created or Updated - Select Credentials and Action Events" width="700" />

Once you've configured your Sage X3 credential, select it from the dropdown and click **Continue**.

---

##### Configuration Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Fetch Data Since (YUPDDATIMDEB) | Specify the date and time to begin fetching item records. (e.g., "2026-01-15 09:00") Set this carefully before activating — changing it later does not affect an already running workflow. |
| Limit (YNBR) | Define the maximum number of records to retrieve per run. (e.g., "100") X3 has no cursor pagination; if more records share one update timestamp than the limit allows, the watermark cannot advance. Set this comfortably above the number of items your system updates within the same second. |
| Item Category (TCLCOD) | Optional. Leave blank to retrieve items from all categories, or specify a category code to filter results (e.g., `NANO`). |

:::note
**Fetch Data Since** and **Limit** are mandatory. **Item Category** is optional and can be adjusted based on your requirements.
:::

Click on **Continue**, then **Run** node.

---

##### How It Works

The connector sends both window bounds in Sage's required ISO 8601 format:
- **Watermark start** (`YUPDDATIMDEB`) — the date/time from your previous run
- **Window end** (`YUPDDATIMFIN`) — the current time

Each run, the watermark advances to the newest `UPDDATTIM` in the batch, ensuring nothing is re-delivered and nothing is skipped.

---

##### Output Schema

Each workflow item contains flat named fields from the Sage X3 item master record:

- `ITMREF` — Item reference/number
- `TCLCOD` — Item category code
- `ITMDES1` — Item description (line 1)
- `STU` — Stock unit
- `UPDDATTIM` — Last update timestamp
- `BASPRI` — Base price
- Additional X3 item fields as configured

Numeric X3 fields arrive as numbers, not strings.

##### Example Configuration

<img src="/img/credentials/sage-x3/sage-x3-trigger-items-config.jpg" alt="Sage X3 Items Created or Updated - Example Configuration" width="700" />

Click on **Continue**, then **Run** node.

#### Inventory Updated

The **Inventory Updated** trigger polls for stock records created or changed since a specified watermark in your Sage X3 instance, using the `YGETSTO` web service.

##### Select Credentials and Action Events

<img src="/img/credentials/sage-x3/sage-x3-trigger-inventory-select-credential.jpg" alt="appse ai Sage X3 Inventory Updated - Select Credentials and Action Events" width="700" />

Once you've configured your Sage X3 credential, select it from the dropdown and click **Continue**.

---

##### Configuration Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Fetch Data Since | Specify the date and time to begin fetching stock records. Set this carefully before activating — changing it later does not affect an already running workflow. |
| Limit | Define the maximum number of stock records to retrieve per run. (default: `100`) X3 has no cursor pagination, so set this comfortably above the number of stock lines your system updates within the same second. |
| Stock Site (YSTOFCY) | Optional. Sage X3 site code, for example `NA011`. Leave blank for every site. |
| Product (YITMREF) | Optional. Restrict to a single product reference. Leave blank for every product. |
| Item Category (YTCLCOD) | Optional. Sage X3 item category code. Leave blank for every category. |
| Warehouse (YWRH) | Optional. Sage X3 warehouse code. Leave blank for every warehouse. |

:::note
**Fetch Data Since** and **Limit** are mandatory. **Stock Site**, **Product**, **Item Category**, and **Warehouse** are optional filters.
:::

Click on **Continue**, then **Run** node.

---

##### How It Works

The connector sends both window bounds in Sage's required ISO 8601 format (`YUPDDATIMDEB` / `YUPDDATIMFIN`), the same watermark pattern used by the item trigger. Each run, the watermark advances to the newest `UPDDATTIM` in the batch.

---

##### Output Schema

Fields returned depend on your Sage X3 stock configuration, but commonly include:

- `ITMREF` — Item reference/number
- `STOFCY` — Stock site
- `WRH` — Warehouse
- `LOT` — Lot number
- `QTYSTU` — Quantity in stock unit
- `STU` — Stock unit
- `TCLCOD` — Item category code
- `UPDDATTIM` — Last update timestamp

##### Example Configuration

#### Product Volume, Customer & Discount Price Updated

Polls for sales price list records created or changed since a specified watermark, using the `YGETSPL` web service. Supports **Product Volume Price** (`T11`), **Product Customer Price** (`T20`), and **Product Customers Discount Price** (`T21`).

##### Select Credentials and Action Events

<img src="/img/credentials/sage-x3/sage-x3-trigger-pricelist-select-credential.jpg" alt="appse ai Sage X3 Price List Updated - Select Credentials and Action Events" width="700" />

---

##### Configuration Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Fetch Data Since (YUPDDATIMDEB) | Specify the date and time to begin fetching price list records. Set this carefully before activating — changing it later does not affect an already running workflow. |
| Limit (YNBR) | Define the maximum number of records to retrieve per run. (default: `10`) X3 has no cursor pagination — set this comfortably above the number of price list lines your system updates within the same second. |
| Price List Type (YPLI) | Select the type of price list to retrieve: **Product Volume Price** (`T11`), **Product Customer Price** (`T20`, default), or **Product Customers Discount Price** (`T21`). |

:::note
All three fields are mandatory. **Price List Type** determines which criteria and price fields are returned — refer to your Sage X3 price list configuration for what each type represents.
:::

Click on **Continue**, then **Run** node.

---

##### How It Works

The connector sends both window bounds in Sage's required ISO 8601 format (`YUPDDATIMDEB` / `YUPDDATIMFIN`), the same watermark pattern used by the other triggers, filtered by the selected **Price List Type** (`YPLI`).

---

##### Output Schema

Fields returned depend on the selected **Price List Type**, but commonly include:

- `YPLI` — Price list type
- `ITMREF` — Item reference (criterion, when applicable)
- `PRI` — Price
- `CUR` — Currency
- `EACDAT` — Effective date
- `UPDDATTIM` — Last update timestamp

##### Example Configuration

## Error Handling

A failed Sage X3 call can originate from four different layers, each with its own error message pattern:

| Layer | Indicator | Message Format |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Network / CDN** | Error codes 522-527 | *"Could not reach Sage X3… (CDN error 522)"* — a hosting or connectivity problem, not a data problem. |
| **Syracuse Gateway** | JSON `$diagnoses`, HTTP 500 | Sage's own message (e.g., *"Header 'soapAction' is missing."*) |
| **SOAP Layer** | `soapenv:Fault` | The `faultstring` from the SOAP fault. |
| **X3 Application** | HTTP 200 with `status=0` | All X3 messages in order: root cause, affected field, and further findings. |

:::important
**X3 returns HTTP 200 for business rejections.** A failed create displays all of X3's messages, not just the first. This is critical for debugging: the HTTP status alone cannot distinguish success from failure.
:::

### Common Error Scenarios

**If you see a CDN error (520–527):**
- The request did not reach Sage X3.
- Check that your host is up and reachable—the same call will fail from Postman or any REST client.
- **Nuance:** Code **522** means the connection never opened (nothing was written); code **524** means Sage accepted the connection but did not answer in time (a create *may* have been applied—check Sage X3 before retrying).

**If you see "rejected the credentials (HTTP 401)":**
- Wrong username or password.
- The user is not authorized for the specified pool.

**If you see "Record does not exist" or other X3 text:**
- The **pool alias is wrong.** X3 answers HTTP 200 here, making this easy to miss.

**If you see "not a valid URL":**
- The endpoint URL is malformed or missing the `CAdxWebServiceXmlCC` path.

---

## Known Limitations

- **No cursor pagination.** `YGETITM`, `YGETSTO`, and `YGETSPL` offer a row limit only. If more records share one `UPDDATTIM` than the limit allows, the watermark cannot advance past them. Set **Limit** comfortably above the number of records your system updates within the same second.
- **Supported operations only.** This connector currently reads items, inventory, and price lists, creates customers and sales orders, and looks up product prices. Other X3 objects and update/delete operations are not yet implemented.
- **Published X3 programs.** `YGETITM`, `YGETSTO`, `YGETSPL`, `YAPPSEBPC`, and `YAPPSESOH` must exist on your tenant. If your instance uses different names, contact support to update the operation URLs.
